## How to run locally üõ†Ô∏è
- Before the following steps make sure you have [git](https://github.com/9588sonuvishwakarma/Itday23)
- Clone the complete project with `git clone 'https://github.com/9588sonuvishwakarma/Itday23' or you can just download the code and unzip it
- *Note:* The master branch doesn't have the updated code used for deployment, to download the updated code used for deployment you can use the following command
  ```
  ‚ùØ git clone -b deploy https://github.com/9588sonuvishwakarma/Itday23
  - `deploy` branch has only the code required for deploying the app (rest of the code that was used for training the models, data preparation can be accessed on `master` branch)
- It is highly recommended to clone the deploy branch for running the project locally (the further steps apply only if you have the deploy branch cloned)
- Once the project is cloned

- Open the localhost url provided after running `app.py` and now you can use the project locally in your web browser.
